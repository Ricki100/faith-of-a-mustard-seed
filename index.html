<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;font-style: normal;text-align: center;">We are a community of faith that lives to tell the world how awesome God is!</h3></br>

<p>The Bible tells us, “He who winneth souls is wise.” (Proverbs 11:30). I don’t know about you, but I want to be a wise woman who wins souls for the Lord in these last days. And something tells me that you do too!!! With that being said, here are some practical ways of how you can win souls to Christ :</p></br>
<ul>
<li>Pray and ask God to give you a boldness and courage like never before!</li>

<li>Brush up on your evangelism skills by reading some articles online or by purchasing a book on witnessing and sharing your faith </li>

<li>Buy some gospel tracts and share them with those God places in your path while you’re out and about</li>

<li>Start up a natural conversation and then wait on an open door to share Christ. </li>

<li>Post a Scripture on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter (before you know it, your friends may be inboxing you for advice or prayer)</li>
</ul></br>

<p>The key is sharing your faith. Don’t be afraid. Heaven is at stake. Individual’s lives and purposes are at stake. Healing and deliverance are theirs to grasp. And you play a vital role in helping them receive what they need…which is a life with Jesus (forever).

One of the greatest joys that we can have as Christians is the joy of leading someone to Christ. Think of it! You and I can be God's instruments in the salvation of others.

Who can have the privilege of leading people to Christ? Any believer!</p></br> 

<p>This is not the work of just a few select people. Every Christian is called upon to witness for Christ, and every Christian can be a soul-winner. The Lord Jesus said,


To His disciples, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19). The implication is that if we are really following, we'll be fishing – soul-winning. Jesus' last words were, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations" (Matthew 28:19). The Christians in the New Testament went everywhere, preaching the Word (Acts 8:4).

How, then, can you and I be effective witnesses for Him?</p></br>


<ol>
<li>Ask God to give you an evangelistic burden for others. Ask Him to help you see the world as He sees it, and to lay upon your heart a handful of people for whom you can earnestly pray. Then pray over those names every day. Keep a little prayer list, and pray for an opportunity of reaching these souls for Christ. An old song says, "Lord, lay some soul upon my heart and love that soul through me; / And may I humbly do my part to win that soul to Thee."</li>

<li>Live a consistent Christian life before these people. Jesus said, "You are the light of the world. . . . Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:14-16). We must live obedient lives of integrity and authentic faith. We must love when others hate, and forgive when others harbor grudges. We must remain trusting when others panic, and be honest when all around us are cooking the books. Not that we're going to be perfect – only Christ was sinless. But we must have a growing, maturing Christian life that others recognize and respect.</li>

<li>Build bridges to others. When the Lord shows you those needing Christ, seek to build a relationship with them. Remember how Jesus went to the home of Zacchaeus where many sinners had gathered? While we must be careful not to place ourselves in an environment where we'll be pulled down, we must be equally careful to cultivate friendships with those needing Christ. Perhaps Christ has placed you in your particular school or workplace just to reach those whom no one else can reach.</li>

<li>Learn the Gospel. Memorize the following verses and practice saying them in a mirror or to another Christian until you're comfortable sharing them with someone needing Christ: Romans 3:23; 6:23; 5:8; 10:9, 10, 13; 1 John 5:1, 13.</li>

<li>Watch for openings to share a word for Christ. Peter said: "Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you" (1 Peter 3:15).</li>

<li>If the right opportunity doesn't come naturally, create one. Sometimes we wait too long, looking for just the right time to invite someone to church or to share with them the message of the Gospel. There often comes a point when we must prayerfully introduce the subject and do our best to impress someone with their need for Christ.</li>

<li>Leave the results with God. We're responsible for sharing the Gospel, but only God can convert the soul.Having done your best let him do the rest. </li>
</ol></br>

<p>Jesus is coming back soon, and we have a role to play in advancing the Kingdom before He comes. People all around you need Jesus. Many in your community or even in your circle of family and friends (even on social media) are hurting, broken, desperate, lonely, without hope, don’t know their purpose, and feel like God doesn’t care about them….and you have the answer. So what are you doing to help them?</p></br>

<p>Jesus has called each and every one of us as Christians to be a part of fulfilling the Great Commission. He has called us to share the Good News with the world and to help others mature in Him. This is what Jesus said before ascending into heaven after His death through Matthew 28:19, “Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.” (NLT)He is commissioning you and me to “go and make disciples.” Once we have accepted Christ, and begun the journey of spiritual maturity, then it’s time to help others come to know and live for the Lord. It’s time to advance the Kingdom of heaven. We are called to be the hands and feet of Jesus Christ. We are commissioned to be ambassadors for Jesus.</p></br> 


The most important thing is to know Jesus for yourself, not religion, not your mom's Jesus or your granny's Jesus 
but YOUR JESUS. We need Him. The firm foundation, the revelation rock  is knowing Jesus for who he is, that is the only thing that won't be shaken. This is what gives us the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven. 


<strong>SPEAK THE NAME ABOVE ALL OTHER NAMES
THE NAME OF JESUS..... </strong>

Start  sharing Christ Today!
